// Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that :

// - accepts the name of a programmer, and
// - returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.

// The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way.
// He owns 18, which is an awesome number of lightsabers.
// Anyone else owns 0.

// Note: your function should have a default parameter.

function howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn(name) {
  return name === 'Zach' ? 18 : 0
}

console.log(howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn()) // 0
console.log(howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn("Adam")) // 0
console.log(howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn("Zach")) // 18
