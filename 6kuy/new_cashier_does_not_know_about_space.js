// Some new cashiers started to work at your restaurant.

// They are good at taking orders, but they don't know how to capitalize words, or use a space bar!

// All the orders they create look something like this:

// "milkshakepizzachickenfriescokeburgerpizzasandwichmilkshakepizza"

// The kitchen staff are threatening to quit, because of how difficult it is to read the orders.

// Their preference is to get the orders as a nice clean string with spaces and capitals like so:

// "Burger Fries Chicken Pizza Pizza Pizza Sandwich Milkshake Milkshake Coke"

// The kitchen staff expect the items to be in the same order as they appear in the menu.

// The menu items are fairly simple, there is no overlap in the names of the items:
/* 
1. Burger
2. Fries
3. Chicken
4. Pizza
5. Sandwich
6. Onionrings
7. Milkshake
8. Coke 
*/
